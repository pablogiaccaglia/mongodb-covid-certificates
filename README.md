This project's purpose is to keep track of **COVID-19 pandemic** data about people, authorized bodies, 
vaccines, tests and, most of all, Covid certificates of vaccination or testing by designing and implementing a document-based 
**MongoDB** database. The primary objective is to support a fast tool that checks the validity of the certificate. 
The data stored allows to extract actionable insights concerning various statistical purposes, involving information such as health services, 
vaccination & testing hubs and vaccine lots, even though the database is not optimized for these tasks, since the already mentioned main goal 
regards certificates validity check.

# System requirements

## Required software

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or higher (only if you want to perform manual load from CSVs)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database
- Python modules in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (only if you want to perform manual load from CSVs)


# üöÄ Setup instructions

## Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/pablogiaccaglia/mongodb-covid-certificates
    cd mongodb-covid-certificates/

## Install required packages

From the project's directory run the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

## Load DB Dump

Download the [database dump](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ahq9yFCnfdZEjuoh3BmchG2HiwhAIg?e=zPUwxa) and navigate to the folder where it is located, then from the command line run something like this:

```
mongorestore -h host.com:port -d covid_certificates -u username -p password downloads/dumps/
```

Assuming that you want to put the contents of the database into a new database called covid_certificates. 


## Load from CSV

To populate the database from the provided CSVs and Python scripts (from which further customizations of the generated data can be performed), the first step to accomplish is to establish a connection to a MongoDB Server. 
The provided code relies on a **MongoDB Atlas** based connection, but it can easly customized to connect to a MongoDB Server on your local machine, as shown <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/pymongo/#connect-to-a-mongodb-server-on-your-local-machine">here</a>.

As you can see in the <a href="scripts/main.py#L289">main</a>  method of the <a href="scripts/main.py">main.py</a> file, a <code>MongoDB</code> object is created in the following way:

```python
    uri = "MONGODB_URI"
    mongoDB = MongoDB(connectionURI = uri)
```

the data passed to the class' constructor is used in the init method to establish a connection through a driver:

```python
   class MongoDB(MongoClient):

    def __init__(self, connectionURI) -> None:
        super(MongoDB, self).__init__(connectionURI, connect = False)
```

After this step all you need to do is execute the main method and wait the routine to complete. 

The Python code manipulates several CSV files which can be found in different versions inside the <a href="datasets">datasets</a> folders.
Detailed information of the manipulation process which lead to the final state of the database can be found in the <a href="report.pdf">Report</a>.

# üìá About mimed certificates

## Certificate of vaccination

This document contains information which reflects a real green certificate. In fact its fields (excepting the **QRCode** field) are compliant to the official 

<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/covid-certificate_json_specification_en.pdf">**European eHealth network COVID certificate JSON Schema Specification**</a>, even though not all the specified fields are here included. In particular these fields are :

- <code>**QRCode**</code>: This string value represent the encoded JSON '**certificateOfVaccination**' document, excluding this field. The process for producing this remotely mimics what the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/vaccination-proof_interoperability-guidelines_en.pdf">European eHealth Trust Framework for Certificates</a> expects. The process we applied is the following:
        
	- JSON Dump of the Python dictionary representing the certificate.
	- UTF-8 encoding of the JSON string.
	- Base 45 encoding of the bytes generated by the previous encoding.
	- Compression with zlib of the previously generated bytes.
	- QR Code Image generation with qrcode Python library.
	- Base 64 encoding of image bytes.
	- Bytes conversion to string.
        
    Through appropriate functions the process can be performed backwards to obtain both the QR Code and the original JSON string.
        
- <code>**diseaseOrAgentTargeted**</code>: This value set has a single entry **840539006** , which is the code for COVID19 from SNOMED CT.

- <code>**vaccineOrProphylaxis**</code>: **SNOMED CT** code indicating the vaccine or prophylaxis used. The mapping is the following:
