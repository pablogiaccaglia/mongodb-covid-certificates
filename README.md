This project's purpose is to keep track of **COVID-19 pandemic** data about people, authorized bodies, 
vaccines, tests and, most of all, Covid certificates of vaccination or testing by designing and implementing a document-based 
**MongoDB** database. The primary objective is to support a fast tool that checks the validity of the certificate. 
The data stored allows to extract actionable insights concerning various statistical purposes, involving information such as health services, 
vaccination & testing hubs and vaccine lots, even though the database is not optimized for these tasks, since the already mentioned main goal 
regards certificates validity check.
